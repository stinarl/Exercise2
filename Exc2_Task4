I find it hard to choose a programming language based on my current knowledge. I used to have quite extensive knowledge about Java and C++, 
but its been twenty years since, the languages have developed and I dont remember much. This leaves me on the bottom floor and I'm
trying to do some proper research on the topic.
Ive focused on reading about Java, C++, Python, Golang and Ada. Ada I have sorted out most because I havent heard of it before and 
assumes it is not widely used in engineering. Ive tried to do som research when it comes to concurrency. It seams to me that C and C++ are the 
only languages among these that dont support built-in threads. C++ still have good ways of supporting concurrency, witch gives me no
more arguments on what to choose. I might have preferred 
C++. I used to be good at it. It is commonly used among engineers and will with certainty be useful to know later. Which is of most importance to me.
Python is known to be easy. It is fast growing in popularity, also used among enginers, and Ive allready started learning it. Since it 
is not recommended to be used in this course based on accessable student assistant knowledge, Ive sorted that out too. 
Java seems to be running out of interest in engineering, at least that is my experience up til now. Otherwise it is simple, widely used in
application development, it is platform independent (as is the other languages mentioned here as well), it is secure, multithreading is easily implemented.
Though it is a bit slow. Sorted out for now because og lack in popularity.
Golang is recomended for this course. It has a memory sefety. It is said to be easy to learn and has a runtime for built-in concurrency by goroutines as 
channels and the select statement. It is as far as I know not commonly used in larger engineering companies. 
But for now this seems to be the preferred language among my group members and classmates as well as the student assistants. 
And with my current knowledge this seams to be the most importent criteria for now.
